            The full form of OPD is the Outpatient Department. An OPD is structured to be the primary point of communication among the patient and the medical professionals in a medical department. A patient who first arrives at the hospital goes straight to OPD, and then the OPD decides the unit to which a patient will go.

            An OPD is typically located in the ground floor of each hospital and split into several parts such as Department of Neurology, Department of Gynecology, Department of Orthopaedics, Department of Oncology, Department of General Medicine and so on. The patient is finishing all the paperwork over here and going to the relevant department.
